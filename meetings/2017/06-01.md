## Agenda

- 5.x
- SSR
- Polyfills
- Func-stateless https://github.com/skatejs/skatejs/issues/1184

### 5.x

Still need to:

- Update docs
- Web compat: add .js suffix, resolve package paths.
- Talk to @matthewp

5.1?

- Flow, convert to both TS and Flow: talk @thejameskyle
- Ensure property definitions are generated
- Maybe go forward with flow in 5.0 (pending get-typed is released) and still maintain TS defs manually until they get better auto-generations
- Could autogenerate and maintain a superset of types for props / component class.

### SSR

- @hotell to see if we can configure Jest to use Undom
- @treshugart to try and hack HTMLElement ctor in JSDOM to not throw "Illegal constructor" error

### Polyfills

- @treshugart to review the make-polyfills-dead-simple PR

### Func-stateless

- @hotell to flesh out issue more
